Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

/*********************
IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/
// Stylus variables (colors and fonts etc...)




// normalize: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
@import "partials/_normalize.styl"

// Stylus Functions
@import "partials/_functions.styl"


//Variables
@import "partials/_variables.styl"

// import stylus mixins
//@import "partials/mixins.styl";
@import 'nib'

// the grid
@import "partials/_grid.styl"

// Stylus Fixes
@import "partials/_fixes.styl"

/*********************
IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
*********************/
//icons

// buttons
@import "modules/_buttons.styl"

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/_forms.styl"
